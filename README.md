# TrustHub

A full-stack web application for the **OpenGov Hackathon 2025**, themed "Good Vibes, Great Governance â€” Building Trust through Data, AI, and Citizen Voices."

## Project Overview

TrustHub is a fact-checking and disinformation mitigation platform that allows users to submit suspicious claims or URLs for verification. The application uses AI (Hugging Face models) and open government data to verify or challenge claims, providing a centralized hub for trustworthy information.

## Features

- Submit suspicious claims or URLs for verification
- AI-powered claim classification (likely true, likely false, or needs review)
- Integration with open government data sources
- Real-time, responsive dashboard of claims and verdicts
- Mobile-friendly and low-bandwidth-ready design
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline access

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **AI**: Hugging Face models (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)
